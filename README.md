Aminuet translates DNA sequences into music by translating codons to amino acids and then amino acids to distinct pitches.

Ideas:
-- Each Amino Acid (22 total) gets a unique pitch.
-- Reads through AA sequence and play pitch for each strand.
-- Allow tempo to be changed.
-- Allow multiple strands/sections to be read at a given time.
